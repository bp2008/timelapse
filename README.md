# timelapse

An ASP.NET web application that organizes, archives, and makes available photos from FTP-capable IP cameras.

## Usage

ASP.NET and Internet Information Services is not required. The application includes an embedded web server and can be run as a Windows Service or as a command line application.

This application is not well polished or documented for users to install, but should be usable by a .NET developer.

## Building

To build this application from source, you will also need my BPUtil utility library: https://github.com/bp2008/BPUtil
